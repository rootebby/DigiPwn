Digispark KickStarter ATtiny85 USB Development Board The ATtiny85 based mini development board is similar to the Arduino, 
but cheaper and smaller (of course a bit less powerful). With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the 
ability to use the familiar Arduino IDE, this board is a great way to jump into microcontroller electronics.

# Requirements
 - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
 - Setup DigiSpark board in Arduino. [Click here for how-to.](https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting).
 - Requires module [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket).

# Installation
